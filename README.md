This is the initial template for react, I have organized each folder in a typical MVC way. This will make it easy for you to deploy early in the project, and I've also compiled react router, redux, and thunk in this src folder. I included the package.json file

## How to use
I assume you have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 installed on your device, and just install react project with command:
```
~#  npx create-react-app your-app-name
```
After that delete or replace the "src" folder in the new project folder that you created earlier with the src folder that I have provided. and you are ready to get started.

If you want, you can copy the contents of my package.json file, and run the command:
```
~# npm install
```
Or if you use yarn:
```
~# yarn install
```
**If you use my package.json file, note that to start the development server "npm dev" not "npm start".**
